For my first hike in the peaks in a very long while, I chose to head to Higher Thor, one of the most popular spot in the Peaks. 

This trail is a circular walk from the Grindleford train station, and goes through clear woodlands and open moorlands. The first half kilometer is very steep, which is the main reason why I marked this walk as intermediate. It is otherwise an easy and very enjoyable walk through beautiful surroundings.

# Overview

After the initial climb from the station through an old stone quarry you will arrive into a clear woodland area, where religious rituals used to be executed. A bit further you will find a great spot for rock climbing and picnics.

The path will then take you deeper into the forest until a wooden gate where you will immediately head back to travel higher and unto open moorlands, with very wide views on the surrounding countryside.

Crossing a road and heading still higher toward *Hathersage Moor* you will pass by several high rock formations, and some of them might remind you of famous characters, such as Master Yoda (for the geeks among you).

From this point you will be heading directly towards higher tor, the highest point in the area and probably one of the most popular for hikers and climbers alike.

From then on you will be heading downward steadily, toward the last part of the hike, which follows the *Padley Gorge trail* along *Burbage Brook*. This path is very popular with families, because it's very easily accessible and passing by several beautiful trees groves and water flows.
