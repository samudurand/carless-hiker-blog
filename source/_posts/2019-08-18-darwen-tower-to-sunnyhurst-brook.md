I had heard of the Darwen Tower, but I had never explored the area yet. And if you judge by the pictures and the content of the walks it is well worth it. This walk is not a challenging one, with a large part of it on more or less flat ground, but it includes multiple type of terrains and numerous areas that really gives you the feeling that you are the only one for kilometers.

# Overview

The walk starts at the Darwen train station. From there head towards the some of the highest quarters of the city and the entrance to the *Darwen moors*. On the way you will pass by a few interesting spots, including an impressive, several parks and a horse farm with unusual breeds.

During summer the moors are very beautiful, full of flowers and wildlife and afford great views of Darwen, so take your time on the way up and why not sit for a minute on one of the benches along the trail.

The *Darwen Tower* is situated at the top of the hill. The hike passes by it, before continuing deeper in the moors.

The trail briefly heads down and out of the *Darwen moor* before returning inside it via another entrance. This section of the moors is a lot less popular than the one surrounding the tower, and gives you the chance to find some peace and silent time, if you so wish.

Eventually the walk leaves the moors and crosses through a large forest and along the *Sunnyhurst brook*, and passes by many gorgeous streams, small waterfalls and riverside rocky beaches.

The river ends at the *Earnsdale Reservoir*, where you will start heading back toward Darwen, via residential areas and the *Sunnyhurst wood*.
