I have always loved walking along the canals, and England is full of them. So for this hike I headed toward Marsden and a walk that starts along its canals before heading toward the high moorlands dominating the area.

This walk is really easy, without any real difficulty and clearly marked paths. More than half of it is situated on flat moorland that seem to extend to the infinite, especially since it is not much frequented by hikers. Plan to take a raincoat or anything else capable of cutting the constant wind that constantly sweep the area.

# Overview

The walk start at the *Huddersfield narrow canal* close by the Marsden train station. You will find a lot of beautiful spots and buildings along this canal and it will probably be the object of one of my future hikes!

After leaving the canal the hike crosses a few properties and eventually goes through an area covered with local vegetable gardens and even an apiary. The locals there were very happy to have a chat about their gardening and honey making secrets.

Follows then a section on the road, then back into more agreeable walking paths, most of them along water streams and tree groves, until you reach the start of the moorlands.

From then on the next few kilometers are on the vast moorlands that surrounds the *Marc Haigh reservoir*. You will find very little people around, except the occasional bicycle hiker. Thus the area is ideal to get impressive shots of wide space and enjoy a sunny day. If you wish you can divert slightly from the path I provided and toward the reservoir itself.

Somewhere along the path you will reach *Standedge*, a major moorland crossing point since roman times. You can find there some real solitude and magnificent views.

The walk continues through the moorlands, passing by a large pond and a pub before finally going down back toward Marsden. Take the time to say hello to some of the many farm animals that graze in the many fields on your way down.
