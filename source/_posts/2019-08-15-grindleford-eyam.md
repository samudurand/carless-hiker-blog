And another walk from *Grindleford*, but this time heading towards *Eyam*, a charming little village with pretty cottages and unusual traditions (public sheep roasting and plague house exhibitions among others). I chose this particular trail because the forecast was really looking grim, with continuous rain the whole afternoon, and this path takes you through many forests and several small villages with many opportunities to find shelter. As you will see from the pictures that forecast didn't hold true, like it often happens in UK. 

**Area:** Dark Peaks in the Peak District
**Cities:** Grindleford, Eyam
**Travel from Manchester:** Manchester Picadilly train station to Grindleford train station (1h00)

# Overview

The hike starts at the *Grindleford" train station, but instead of heading directly towards the centre of the city, it takes you around the back of the station and through several grazing fields. I made this diversion to avoid as much road as possible, because walking on asphalt isn't much fun... On the way you will pass by several cosy houses, and the remain of an old church well worth the small detour. The area is also crossed by many water streams that were especially going strong thanks to the rain of the previous days.

After crossing briefly through the village streets, the trail continues into the "Haywood National Trust" forest. It is crossed by many paths, some well maintained and obviously intended for hikers, and others that can become mudy and quite challenging on rainy days.

But this makes the walk more interesting and the forest itself is much more clear and cleaner than most I visited in the Peaks.

After the foresty area comes a long stretch of fields, intermittently interrupted by small cottages and crossing the village of *Froggatt*.

The walk then comes down from the hill to follow for a while the *Derwent river*. There you can find several nice spots for a picnic or just to take a quick rest. Which you might need since the walk soon leaves the river side and heads back up and towards the next village.

*Stoney Middletown*, which you will reach next, has a few things to see, including a (suspected to be) roman bath and few beautiful churches.

When leaving the village you will have to hike up a steep hill, which will give you the chance to get some great views of the surrounding valleys. If you look around you will see several signs indicating that you are on the *Heritage trail*, a moderately known trail crossing several villages and helping visitors to discover the local history and cultural spots.

That trail will take you to Eyam, a very interesting and relatively popular village for hikers and tourists. It seems to have several strange traditions, among them public sheep roasting and the detailed display of the history of several old houses where whole families died from the black plague. As you can imagine not all signs in the village are very cheerful, but it is certainly history that is worth discovering nonetheless.

After a tour inside the village the hike takes you back toward Grindleford and the start of the hike, along fields and forest paths, as well as a section of road. Take the time to enjoy the views that this last section affords.
