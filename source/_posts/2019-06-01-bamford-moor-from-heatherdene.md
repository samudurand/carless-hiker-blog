This is the first walk I share that doesn't start at a train station, but instead at a bus stop, and it is not as easy to reach as the previous ones, but it is really worth it. It is located around the picturesque *Heatherdene* area, and is a combination of hill climbs and moorlands walks, including a large portion done outside all marked paths and in the middle of the wilderness (with a surprising amount of birds and wildlife).

**Area:** Heatherdene, Dark peaks in the Peak district
**Cities:** Bamford
**Travel from Manchester:** Northern train line from Manchester Picadilly to Bamford then H1/H2 or 273/275 bus (1h40)

# Overview

The walk start at the *Yorkshire Bridge Hotel* bus stop. From there head toward the hill to the north, along the *Ladybower Reservoir*, and across a bridge, where you will find the real beginning of the hike.

Here starts a very steep climb up to the top of the hill. The slope is tough, but persevere and you will find your reward: a wide view of the reservoir and surrounding fields.

You will realise quickly that this hill is very large, and crossed by many paths popular for hiking and cycling.

This section of the walk covers a large portion of the moorland, then drop down across a very busy road (cautious when crossing), before heading into a forest of tall pines ahead.

It's a little while later that this hike leaves all paths behind to turn toward the wilderness and a flat and isolate part of the moorland. There is almost no paths to be found on this section, it's entirely a walk by the compass (heading roughly South).

It will bring you in the middle of nowhere, but there you will hear an unexpected amount of birds and maybe even find some of their nests. In this area are also scattered numerous old stones, low stone walls and even a few cairns if you are lucky enough to find them under the vegetation. This is the perfect place if you are looking for some solitude.

After leaving this haven of peace, back to the very frequented paths, which will lead you to the *Bamford Ridge*, where you can get another good view of the reservoirs. This is popular spot for climbers and hikers alike.

The walks then slowly turns down back towards *Heaterdene Car Park*, through a dark and strange forest, reputed for being haunted. I couldn't confirm the haunted part, but it certainly gives a somber vibe.

Once at the car park, you are only a few minutes away from the bus stop that will bring you back to the Bamford train station. You will probably have to wait for it (buses are not very regular around there), which you can do with a cold beer at the *Yorshire bridge Inn*.
