This one is a lazy walk on the high grounds above *Todmorden*, just above the north edge of the Peaks. The city of *Todmorden* itself is worth a visit and the surrounding areas even more so. I heard there was somewhere up there a rock looking very much like a lost Easter Island stone head, but I couldn't find it, maybe you will have more luck than me ?

**Area:** Peak District
**Cities:** Todmorden

# Overview

The walk starts at the *Todmorden train station*. From there you will have to reach the outskirts of the city through its numerous and sinuous streets, then start the hill climb covered with forest patches.

Once out of the woods the paths continues up and through several farms and pastures. If you need a snack on the way you can pickup some blueberries on the bushes growing along the path.

The next section is an isolated road, very little used. Not the most interesting area, but it is the quickest way to reach the local summits.

The top of the hill is covered with stones that seem to have been thrown around by a giant playing some mysterious game. This is where is hidden somewhere an Easter Island like head, of which I saw pictures but couldn't find it to take one myself...

From there, the hike heads down, through fields and several beautiful small tree patches and hidden flowery spots, where you can sit down for a relaxing moment or even a picnic (take care to not sit on one of the many ant nests of the area).

The last part of this walk includes multiple paths of various make, including countryside rocky tracks and concrete roads.

The way back to the station passes through the main park of the city, and is the home to many animals, including not-so-shy squirrels.
