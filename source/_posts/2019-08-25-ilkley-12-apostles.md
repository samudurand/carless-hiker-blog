Today I decided to explore somewhere other than the peaks, and went for a little hike close by *Leeds*. It's not an area quick to reach from Manchester, but there is regular train and bus services to *Ilkley*, where the hike starts. The area offers some pretty remarkable spots, especially the *12 apostles* (an ancient circle of 12 old stones), and the *Cow and Calf*, a spot extremely popular in the region. Overall an easy walk, perfect for a Sunday.  

**Area:** Leeds
**Cities:** Leeds, Ilkley
**Travel from Manchester:** Manchester Picadilly train station to Ilkley train station via Leeds train station (2h00)

# Overview

The walk starts at the *Ilkley train station* and from there continues towards the high grounds at the back of the city. The walk up to reach the moor is relatively steep but quite short, and pass by small cafe, which also contains a water basin, reputed for "maybe" granting wishes.

From the cafe, the path continues toward the moor via a light slope and through the remains of one of the many stone quarry of the area.

At the top you will get your first view of the moors, that seem to spread for several kilometers in all directions.

The hike will eventually bring you to a very popular local spot: *the 12 apostles*. It is an ancient circle of stones, surmised to have had originally up to 20 stones, and that was probably used to observe the movements of the sun or other celestial bodies.

From there you will be walking a while longer around the moors, passing by several hunting installations, as well as the locally famous rock formation *Cow and Calf*.

The walk then heads back toward Ilkley, passing by several beautiful places, such as waterfalls, stone quarries (always popular for climbers), and several streams ideal to dip your feet on a hot day.
