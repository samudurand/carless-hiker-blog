Today I went to visit the Macclesfield area, and I took the opportunity to go visit the *Tegg's Nose Country Park*. This hike starts from Macclesfield center and head toward the park via grazing fields and small villages, with beautiful old houses and cottages all along the roads sections. 

**Area:** Macclesfield
**Cities:** Macclesfield, Langley
**Travel from Manchester:** Manchester Picadilly train station to Macclesfield train station (30 min)

# Overview

The hike starts from the *Pool Street Industrial Estate bus station*, 5 min walk from the main Macclesfield train station. From there the walk heads up toward the *Macclesfield gold club*, then follows along its borders in a woody walk. It then continues on grazing grasslands occupied by numerous cows and sheeps, and with a nice view on the surrounding villages.

This path eventually ends in Langley and passes by a multiple of renovated and old houses and cottages, most of them worth a good look and a few pictures. After visiting the village, the walk reaches the city's reservoirs and the entrance of the Tegg's Nose park.

The hike up the Tegg's Nose hill is a tough one, so take things slow and you will eventually reach the top, and the fantastic view from it, as well as a local sea of blueberries bushes.

Once you had enough of the view, you can head down along several roads, before finally reaching a cultivated area (with views almost worth painting), and heading toward the Macclesfield station to finish the tour.
