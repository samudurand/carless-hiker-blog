Another easy walk, this one going through the high ground around Marple and its *Etherow Country Park*. The walk will take you through some of the loveliest parts of Marple, before heading outside the city toward the grasslands surrounding it. The second half then turns back down toward the Etherow park and water areas, including one of the most popular waterfall there.

**Area:** West side of the Peak District

# Overview

The walk starts at the Marple train station. From there you will head towards some of the highest part of the city, until reaching the high grounds above it. On the way you will be passing through many beautiful new or renovated houses, as well as some very interesting gardens.

The way to the highgrounds includes several rock paths, some of them even making for great pictures, and well worth a brief stop.

After following a slowly ascending slope, you will arrive on a great spot for getting a wide view of the land surrounding Marple.

The path continues for a while on a relatively even ground and passes among several farms, and floks sheeps (no surprise there, England fields are full of them!), before heading back down toward the *Etherow Country Park*.

If you went during the morning like me, the paths should have been until now largely deserted, but this will change as soon as you reach the park. It is a very popular spot for families, especially on Sunday, and the area at the end of the park even hosts regular festivals and markets. The park is covered with rivers and waterways, including the locally well known *Marple Waterfall*.

The last part of the tour goes through this park, then back toward the train station, with a slight detour through another local park and along a canal.
