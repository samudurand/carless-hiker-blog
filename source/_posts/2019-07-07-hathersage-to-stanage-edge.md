This weekend I headed for *Stanage Edge*, a well known and long cliff that overlooks *Hathersage* and other villages of the same area. The first half is an upwards walk under the quiet forests canopies and in the grasslands, while the second is a much more popular path frequented by both bikes and families. Very nice for a Sunday hike!  

**Area:** Peak District
**Cities:** Hathersage
**Travel from Manchester:** Train from Manchester Picadilly station to Hathersage train station (01h00)

# Overview

The walk starts in the centre of Hathersage where you will quickly leave the busy main street and head toward the back of the residential area and one of the small forest just at the limit of the village. There, the quiet canopies are crossed by multiple water streams, as well as several wood bridges allowing to cross them.

After emerging from the trees, the walk continues across very lush grasslands, and then cross a few local farms, before starting to climb towards the higher grounds.

You will soon find yourself in view of Stanage Edge, which you will reach using one of several hidden path crossing an area covered with very thick bushes.

Take a moment to look around once you arrive at the top of the Edge, the view is definitely worth it.

After following for a short time the top of the edge, the hike heads back down along a path much more frequented and popular with families, since it is a much easier way than the one you used to arrive to the top.

Along the way down toward Hathersage take the time to look around you, since the area abounds with beautiful old manors and a large variety of farm animals, some even coming from unusual breeds (according to a local farmer).

Just before the walk ends, you will be passing through the local cemetery, very well maintained, just like the church that guards it.
