Second walk starting at Grindleford ! It should be no surprise since the area is full of beautiful spots, and most of them very little known. This time I went for a walk around the *Longshaw Estate* and along the *Grindstones Edge* that overlooks it. It's the perfect spot to encounter numerous animals, both domestic and wild ones. 

**Area:** Dark peaks in the Peak District

# Overview

From the Grindleford train station head up along the steep paths that follow the hill slope. This will take you up to the grasslands and open views on the surrounding countryside.

While up there take care to be quiet and you might see or even meet some of the local wildlife.

Hiking a while longer up the hill will bring you to the entrance to the *Longshaw Estate*, which is a very large animal farming area, where you will cross the path of herds of sheeps and other farm animals.

Along the way you should have the chance to see in the distance the most famous high spot of the area, the well known *Higher Tor*.

The hike then takes you higher towards the *Grittstones Edge*, where you will travel for a few kilometers along the cliff. Take the time to discover the few isolated cottages and magnificent views that it affords.

At some point the hike turns down, leaving the Edge that continues for quite a bit longer, and crosses once more the Estate before reaching the end and starting point in Grindleford.
